# Web3 IP Tokenization Platform - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Reference-Based with Modern Web3 Aesthetic

Drawing inspiration from leading Web3 platforms (OpenSea, Uniswap, Rainbow Wallet) while establishing a unique identity for intellectual property tokenization. The design balances futuristic innovation with professional trust-building, essential for both crypto-natives and traditional IP creators.

**Core Principles:**
- Establish credibility through clean, professional layouts
- Convey innovation through modern Web3 visual language
- Create intuitive flows for both Web3 veterans and newcomers
- Build trust through transparency and clarity
